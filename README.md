# packer-lookalike

Use [Packer](https://www.packer.io/) to build test images that look sort of
like hosting/cloud providers for testing.

## Thanks to...

Chef's [Bento](http://chef.github.io/bento/) project, which was my original
starting point for packer. Some of the scripts and probably the kickstart are
still recognizably based on theirs.

## c7-linode

Build a VirtualBox CentOS 7 image with roughly the same packages as a Linode
VPS.
